## Abstract
Recommendation systems have developed over the years, making search and find much
easier. Movie recommendation systems, in particular, help movie enthusiasts by suggesting
different movies, based on the userâ€™s interest. This saves the user from the long process of
choosing from a large set of movies, which can go up to thousands and millions. The intent
of this project is to focus on the interpretation of the two different approaches of the movie
recommendation system, namely Collaborative filtering and Content-based filtering. This
will be done by implementing both filtering systems by use of the required algorithms and
prediction metrics, along with an appropriate dataset. The end-result is a list of movie
recommendations and a detailed analysis of each system, leading to the conclusion that
Collaborative filtering is the better approach.
